-- 5 employees whose managerId is the manager's id
select name from Employee
where id in(
    select managerId
    from employee
 where managerId is not null
group by managerId
having count(*) >= 5
)


-- Why a subquery?
-- 💡 Because you're solving two separate tasks:
-- 🔍 1. Find the ids of managers who have ≥ 5 direct reports
--    2. Get the name of each manager using their id
