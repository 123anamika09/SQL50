-- Why Use a JOIN in the DELETE?
-- Because in SQL, to delete duplicates, you must:

-- Identify which rows are duplicates.
-- Find the one row to keep (the one with the smallest id).
-- Delete the other rows with the same email but higher id.
-- To do that, we use a self-join on the table.


delete p1
from Person p1
--   Person p1: These are the rows we are trying to delete.
join Person p2 
--   Person p2: These are the "keeper" rows with smaller id for the same email.
on p1.email = p2.email  and p1.id > p2.id;
